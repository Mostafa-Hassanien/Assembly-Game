This is a two-player game using assembly language. It provides two different modes; the first one is playing on the same PC. The other mode is playing on two different PCs connected to each other using serial communication. Moreover; it provides two phases. The play-winning way is to defeat your opponent using your available limited number of bullets, try to avoid other opponent's bullet and/or the fire face in phase 2, and collect game prizes as much as you can. The game prizes are freeze, bullets, bombs, hearts, and shield.
